# Overview

Wonkes is a web application that allows users to sell and buy items with just a click of a button. Users can create postings, browse for products, and connect with the community. It utilizes various technologies useful to web application creation, including:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) hosting service that deploys project online and hosts database.

With this tech stack, this is what we are implementing:

* A functioning landing page with listings, a user page, and a add listings page.
* Interface built with boostrap 5 for a responsive and multi-platform friendly design
* Initialization code to define users, listings, and category tags
* Use of bootstrap and typescript components to implement/manage a responsive layout with interactive elements
* A secure sign-up/sign-in page allowing the user permissions and access based on their role.
* Authorization examples: certain pages are public (View Listings, Login Page), while other pages require login (Admin Dashboard).
